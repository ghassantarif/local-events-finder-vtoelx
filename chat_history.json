Features for the First Version:**\n\n-   **Home Screen (Event Listings):** Display a list of upcoming events, fetched from a mock data source initially. Each event should show basic details like name, date, time, and a brief description.\n-   **Filters:** Implement category and distance filters. The category filter should allow users to select event types (e.g., music, sports, arts). The distance filter should allow users to specify a radius (e.g., 5km, 10km, 20km).\n-   **Event Details Screen:** Tapping on an event in the list should navigate to a details screen with more information about the event.\n\n**2. Design Elements:**\n\n-   **Colors:**\n    -   Background: `#F5F5F5` (Light gray for a clean look)\n    -   Text: `#212121` (Dark gray for readability)\n    -   TextSecondary: `#757575` (Medium gray for less important text)\n    -   Primary: `#3F51B5` (Indigo for main interactive elements)\n    -   Secondary: `#E91E63` (Pink for accents)\n    -   Accent: `#FF4081` (Bright pink for highlights)\n    -   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White for event cards)\n    -   Highlight: `#BBDEFB` (Light blue for selected filters)\n-   **Typography:** Use a modern, clean font like \"System\" (default for the platform) or consider loading \"Roboto\" for a consistent look across platforms.\n\n**3. Implementation Plan:**\n\n1.  **Create Mock Data:** Create a `data.ts` file (or similar) in the `app` directory to hold an array of event objects. Each object should have properties like `id`, `name`, `category`, `description`, `date`, `time`, `location` (with latitude and longitude), and `distance`.\n2.  **Modify Home Screen (`app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`):**\n    -   Fetch the mock event data.\n    -   Display the events in a `FlatList`.\n    -   Implement the category and distance filters using `useState` hooks to manage the filter values.\n    -   Filter the event data based on the selected filters before rendering the `FlatList`.\n    -   Add navigation to the Event Details Screen when an event item is pressed.\n3.  **Create Event Details Screen:** Create a new file `app/event/[id].tsx` (or similar) to display the details of a selected event. Use dynamic routing to pass the event ID to this screen.\n4.  **Update Tab Layout:** Ensure the tab layout in `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` correctly navigates to the home screen.\n5.  **Styling:** Apply the specified colors and typography to the components. Use `StyleSheet.create` for styling.\n\n**4. Coding Agent Instructions:**\n\n1.  Create a `data.ts` file in the `app` directory with mock event data.\n2.  Modify `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` to:\n    -   Fetch and display the mock event data in a `FlatList`.\n    -   Implement category and distance filters.\n    -   Add navigation to an Event Details Screen.\n3.  Create a new file `app/event/[id].tsx` to display event details.\n4.  Apply the specified colors and typography to the components.\n5.  Remove the `modalDemos` array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional local event finder app!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-04T08:34:07.971701"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you build a local event finder app with the specified features.
